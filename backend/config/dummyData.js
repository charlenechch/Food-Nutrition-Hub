                  This staple dish is an important part of Dayak cuisine and is frequently served at traditional events and community feasts. \
                  The dish is made from sago, a type of starch produced from the sago palm. \
                  Sago is mixed with water to produce a thick, sticky paste, which is then steamed to get its gelatinous and chewy texture. \
                  Linut is usually bland, making it a great carrier for savoury side dishes such as meat stews, spicy sambal, or rich gravies prepared using meat or seafood.",

    Its name, “Aruk,” drawn from the Sarawakian Malay dialect, literally signifies “charred,” a nod to this distinctive method. \
    The dish is composed simply of rice combined with anchovies, fragrant torch ginger, turmeric leaves, and the heat of bird’s-eye chilli.",
